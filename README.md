# Prodigy InfoTech Internship: Data Analysis Insights

Welcome to the Prodigy InfoTech Internship repository! This repository contains my work for Task 1 of the internship, which focuses on data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and discovering meaningful insights from data.

## Task Overview

The objective of this task was to create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable—such as age or gender—within a given population dataset.

## Skills & Insights Gained

Through this task, I improved my data visualization skills by learning how to effectively represent categorical and continuous variables using bar charts and histograms. This allowed me to better interpret and communicate patterns in population demographics and other datasets.
