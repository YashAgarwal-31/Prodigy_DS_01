#Prodigy InfoTech Internship: Data Analysis Insights
Welcome to the Prodigy InfoTech Internship repository! This repository contains my work for Task 1 of the internship, which focuses on data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and uncovering meaningful insights from data.

#Task Overview
The objective of this task was to create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable—such as age or gender—within a given population dataset.

#Skills & Insights Gained
Through this task, I enhanced my skills in data visualization by learning how to effectively represent categorical and continuous variables using bar charts and histograms. This helped me better understand how to interpret and communicate patterns in population demographics and similar datasets.
